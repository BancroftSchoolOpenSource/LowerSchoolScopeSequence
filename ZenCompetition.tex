{\huge \textbf{Zen Robotics Competition}}

{\huge \textbf{Purpose}}
\vspace{1cm}

The purpose of this competition is to encourage students to become good engineers. A good engineer is defined as someone who builds systems that accomplish tasks with accessible designs, give and revive aid among peers, and competes to push forward the edge of the known possible. 

Accessible designs means that the designs, tools and components are accessible to all competitors, and non competitors equally. Designs and code should be housed in publicly facing VCS system. Tools should be free and open source to all people. The intent is to prevent enclosure of students skills by companies.  Components should be generic commodity components or be manufactured with open licenses for multi-vendor sourcing.  

To give and revive aid means that you use the tools and sources of others and assume that the tools and code you create will be used. This means being a responsible user of open source code. You should also be a responsible creator of code and documentation. The aid you revive, and then pay forward should be  balanced. 

To push forward the edge of the known possible means that we compete against physics, not against each other nor against the rules. The purpose of the rules is to ensure collaboration and an even playing field. Since there can be as many winners as there are teams that accomplish the task, there is not a motivation to compete against another team of students. We want to see designs and software that can accomplish tasks, and to see how different folks choose and remix designs to push forward. 

  
This competition is designed to encourage these principals in each student. The intent of the rules and scoring structure is to encourage collaboration across teams and a across the world. Students compete against the competition, not against each other. Each teams accomplishments are intended to be acknowledged on their own merits. We are all competing together against the edge of the known possible,
