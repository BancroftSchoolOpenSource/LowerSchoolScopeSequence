{\huge \textbf{Zen Robotics Competition}}

\vspace{1cm}

{\huge \textbf{Purpose}}
\vspace{1cm}

The purpose of this competition is to encourage students to become good engineers. A good engineer is defined as someone who builds systems that accomplish tasks with accessible designs, give and revive aid among peers, and competes to push forward the edge of the known possible. In short, we intend to inject hope into the world through inspiring feats of engineering.

Accessible designs means that the designs, tools and components are accessible to all competitors, and non competitors equally. Designs and code should be housed in publicly facing VCS system. Tools should be free and open source to all people. The intent is to prevent enclosure of students skills by companies.  Components should be generic commodity components or be manufactured with open licenses for multi-vendor sourcing.  

To give and revive aid means that you use the tools and sources of others and assume that the tools and code you create will be used. This means being a responsible user of open source code. You should also be a responsible creator of code and documentation. The aid you revive, and then pay forward should be  balanced. 

To push forward the edge of the known possible means that we compete against physics, not against each other nor against the rules. The purpose of the rules is to ensure collaboration and an even playing field. Since there can be as many winners as there are teams that accomplish the task, there is not a motivation to compete against another team of students. We want to see designs and software that can accomplish tasks, and to see how different folks choose and remix designs to push forward. 

  
This competition is designed to encourage these principals in each student. The intent of the rules and scoring structure is to encourage collaboration across teams and a across the world. Students compete against the competition, not against each other. Each teams accomplishments are intended to be acknowledged on their own merits. We are all competing together against the edge of the known possible,

{\huge \textbf{Overview}}
\vspace{1cm}

\textbf{Competition description:} The competition will consist of a standard obstacle course, through which a robot will traverse. Robots will be constrained by the design and construction rules below. Obstacles will be added to the end as needed to the end of the course to ensure balanced difficulty. Early sections of the course will be stable for an extended period of time. 

Students will compete in independent categories for:
\begin{enumerate}
	
\item distance through the course
 
\item  time of completion
 
\item  design contribution
 
\item  code contribution
 
 \item build quality, adornment and animation
\end{enumerate}

 At the end of the course will be a button, which the robot must press to have completed the course. The time through the course is measured and compared for the completion time award. Separate awards will be given for each robot to accomplish the course. If no robot accomplishes the whole course, then the robots will be scored solely on total distance through the course. 
 
 An award for contribution to code will be given to the team that contributes a code contribution that affects the control of the robot and accomplishes some aspect of the challenge, and is well documented and easily accessible for other teams. 
 
 An award for build quality, adornment and animation will be given for the care given to the aesthetics of the robot and especially the attention paid to human robot interaction. Robots that are perceived well and interact well with judges will be eligible for this award.

{\huge \textbf{Definitions}}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Open Source:} When all of the files used to create an application or design are available.
	\item \textbf{Vitamins:} components generally available, preferable with multiple sources
	\item \textbf{Save-point:} A point in the course where your robot is expected to perform an animation for the crowd.  
\end{enumerate}

{\huge \textbf{Rules}}

\begin{enumerate}
	
\item \textbf{Composition Of Robot:} A robot that competes in the competition must be composed of FFF printed parts made on an approved printer in an approved material with sources provided, Viamins from the approved list with BoM provided and cloth or paper elements with provided sources. 

\item \textbf{Open Source Requirement:} All of the sources for the design elements of the robot, the robots control code, all dependent libraries, and all software tools used must be open source at the time of competition. 

\item \textbf{Program execution:} Robots must communicate to the competition station using the provided protocol. A robots competition code is run by the judges based on the Git URl and tag associated with the competition. 


\item \textbf{Performance:} Before proceeding into the obstacle course, the robot will be judged on a 90 second animation intended to hype up the crowd. At each save-point through the course another 90 second animation will be required.
